        <p class="content__paragraph">
          Creative crises, it seems, are experienced by everyone sooner or
          later. It often happens that you face a problem, can't solve it at
          first, and start thinking that you are incapable of anything. The
          brain memorizes this behavioral pattern, and the next day, you don't
          feel like doing anything at all – because, after all, nothing will
          work out anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          
How to break out of such a stagnation? There are different options, and we will talk about one of the most creative ones – a deck of cards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="content__title heading">What kind of deck is this?</h2>
      <div class="content__text-block content__text-block_type_first-lettered">
        <p class="content__paragraph">
            It could have been something about the benefits of playing "Hearts" or about the Major Arcana of Tarot, but we have another deck in mind. It's called Oblique Strategies. The first deck was created back in 1975 by the composer, music producer, and one of the founders of the ambient genre, Brian Eno, and multimedia artist Peter Schmidt.

Oblique Strategies is primarily used by musicians, but the deck is suitable for overcoming creative blocks in any field. It is recommended for writers, product managers, artists, and developers.
        </p>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          
The deck consists of over a hundred cards, each containing just one phrase. These phrases are often quite abstract. For example, "What mistake did you make last time?" or "Replace ambiguity with specificity," or even "Add something else." These phrases are meant to be applied to a problem or creative block. How exactly you apply them is up to you.

      <h2 class="content__title heading">How do "Oblique Strategies" work?</h2>
      <div class="content__text-block content__text-block_type_first-lettered">
        <p class="content__paragraph">
        Here's what Brian Eno himself says about the creation of Oblique Strategies:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="content__blockquote">
          
"These cards came about because I found myself in working situations (especially in recording studios) where, under pressure, I would often forget that there were other indirect ways of approaching problems besides the direct, obvious ones. And often these indirect approaches were much more interesting than the direct ones."
        </blockquote>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
          
Thus, Eno's deck encourages us to see obstacles not as dead ends but as starting points for finding more interesting solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="content__paragraph">
         
And by the way, it's not necessary to hunt for rare physical decks of Oblique Strategies anymore—especially since they're quickly snatched up by fans of Eno. There are quite attractive websites with digital equivalents of the cards and applications available.
